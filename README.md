CGTutorial
==========

Basic tutorial screen based on someone else's project. Needs to have images routed through as names to eliminate use of imageNamed: calls on accident which leads to a retain on the images, leading to a very large amount of memory use. Also needs to have tutorial descriptions loaded through text document so that they can be changed more easily and edited outside of Xcode.
